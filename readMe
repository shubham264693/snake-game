-This is basic snake-game application which is deployed using jenkins and git-hub webhooks

-Within this deployment process we have created two ec2-servres

- both ec2 with t2.medium and 15 gb of storage

- fist one will become our master node where jenkins web server will be running

- second one will be worker node where our all the jobs will be running

- Here we have setup the jenkins agent on worker node so it can run the jobs which are created by the master node

- After this process we will be creating the dynamic worker node using dokcer which will be deleted after running jobs
